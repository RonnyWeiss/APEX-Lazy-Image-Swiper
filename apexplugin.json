    "description": "This plug-in is a cool image slider for Oracle APEX. It loads the images only when they are needed (Lazy Load) and can load images from a BLOB table or from a URL. The list of images is passed by SQL statement. URL and download of blob tables can be mixed. In addition, a link URL can be passed, which is called if you double click on the displayed image.<p><b>Important clarification: My work in the development team of Oracle APEX is in no way related to my open source projects or the plug-ins here on apex.world! All plug-ins are built in my spare time and are not supported by Oracle!</b></p>",
