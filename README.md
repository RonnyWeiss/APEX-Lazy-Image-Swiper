This plug-in is a cool image slider for Oracle APEX. It loads the images only when they are needed (Lazy Load) and can load images from a BLOB table or from a URL. The list of images is passed by SQL statement. URL and download of blob tables can be mixed. In addition, a link URL can be passed, which is called if you double click on the displayed image.
